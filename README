This is a simple tool I use to help merge contributions from other users into 
one Simulink model.  I am unaware of other non-commercial tools to accomplish 
this task.

UNIQUE = mergeDiff(SRCMODEL, DSTMODEL) compares block names and dialog 
parameters from two similar models. In the process, DSTMODEL will
be updated with parameter values and missing blocks from SRCMODEL.

Blocks are color coded upon completion:
 White - Block is unique to DSTMODEL or unchanged from SRCMODEL
 Green - Block was missing from DSTMODEL
 Orange - Block's parameters were updated
 Yellow - Subsystem contains modifications

This function does not examine connecting lines.  The user should review
and connect these colored blocks manually to complete the merge.

Returns names of blocks unique to DSTMODEL.

EXAMPLE
% Merge contributions from another Simulink user's model
load_system('hismodel');
open_system('mymodel');
mergeDiff('hismodel', 'mymodel');
